/**
 * Installs the {@link FacesViewsViewHandler}.
 * <p>
 * <i>Implementation note</i>: this needs to be done during the {@link PostConstructApplicationEvent}, in
 * which it's guaranteed that Faces initialization (typically done via a {@link ServletContextListener}) has
 * been done. Setting a view handler programmatically requires the Faces {@link Application} to be present
 * which isn't the case before Faces initialization has been done.
 * <p>
 * Additionally, the view handler needs to be set BEFORE the first faces request is processed. Putting
 * the view handler setting code in a {@link Filter#init(javax.servlet.FilterConfig)} method only works
 * when all init methods are called during startup, OR when the filter filters every request.
 * <p>
 * For a guide on FacesViews, please see the <a href="package-summary.html">package summary</a>.
